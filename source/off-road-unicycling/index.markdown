<p>Among off-road bicycle riders, there is the minimalist type. These are the riders who ride a single-speed bicycle (no gears), a rigid bicycle (no suspension) or a "fixie" (no freewheel mechanism). Off road unicycling is all about dropping the last training wheel, mastering true minimalism and awing those so-called minimalist bicycle riders as you swoosh by.</p>

<p>Unicycling is also great for drawing attention. Here I am competing with my girlfriend whether a unicyclist or a hot chick with an umbrella would get more watery love in a water war.</p>
