<p>Contact Juggling is a combination of juggling, miming and dance. Or rather, that's what it is when some good <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syhHFKVLX9g">does it</a>. I mostly like to keep myself busy and this hobby somehow evolved from stepping only on same color tiles back in elementary school (Yes, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Stepping-On-Only-One-Color-Of-The-Tiles-Because-The-Others-Are-Lava-D/334429479072">lots of people</a> do that).</p>
<p>Having already gotten into Contact Juggling, here is a video I made...</p>
